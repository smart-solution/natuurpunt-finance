    In theory one request could be stripped, but the SWIFT terms of use prevent
    automated usage, so user like behavior is required.

    Update January 2012: Always return None, as the SWIFT page to retrieve the
    information does no longer exist. 
    If demand exists, maybe bite the bullet and integrate with a paid web
    service such as http://www.iban-rechner.de.
    lp914922 additionally suggests to make online lookup optional.
