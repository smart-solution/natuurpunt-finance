Easy Reconcile
==============

This is a shared work between Akretion and Camptocamp
in order to provide:
 - reconciliation facilities for big volume of transactions
 - setup different profiles of reconciliation by account
 - each profile can use many methods of reconciliation
 - this module is also a base to create others
   reconciliation methods which can plug in the profiles
 - a profile a reconciliation can be run manually
   or by a cron
 - monitoring of reconciliation runs with an history
   which keep track of the reconciled Journal items

2 simple reconciliation methods are integrated
in this module, the simple reconciliations works
on 2 lines (1 debit / 1 credit) and do not allow
partial reconcilation, they also match on 1 key,
partner or Journal item name.

You may be interested to install also the
``account_advanced_reconciliation`` module.
This latter add more complex reconciliations,
allows multiple lines and partial.
